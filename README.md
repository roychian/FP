# FP

This proggram is "Fitness Advisor",produced by team 14(banana_screaming).  
To execute the proggram,download the files,and open the file "FP-main\FP-main" in vscode,  
and compile it with "gcc -I src/include -L src/lib -o run FP_MAIN.c -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image",  
which will generate the "run.exe".And you can execute the proggram with that.  

The proggram is divided into 4 part,initial profile,check all movement,training record and buckerlist.  
  
## 1)initial profile  
enter some profile to setup the appropriate data of movement.  

## 2)check all movement  
you can check all movement that are classified into six class(chest,leg,back,shoulder,arm,core).  
There is a SDL window to demonstrate these movements.  
(WARING! You have to close the SDL window before continue the proggram.)
